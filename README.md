# ✨ Project 5 – Animated Landing Page (Aurora Sync)

A single-page **landing site** for a fictional product, built using **HTML5 and pure CSS3**.  
Features smooth animations, transitions, and polished responsive design — all without JavaScript.

## 🧭 Overview

**Goal:**  
Demonstrate advanced CSS techniques: keyframe animations, transitions, transforms, pseudo‑elements, and BEM naming conventions.

**Focus:**  
Polish, visual rhythm, and responsive motion.

## 🧩 Features

- 🎬 **Animated Hero Section** – heading slides and fades in on load  
- ⚡ **Features Grid** – staggered “on‑scroll” style fade‑ups  
- 💬 **Testimonials** – sequential card animations  
- 🚀 **Call‑to‑Action Section** – highlighted end section with hover transitions

## 🧠 Reflection

**What I Learned**
- How to orchestrate multiple animations with timing harmony
- Using minimal motion to emphasize instead of distract
- Importance of clean, reusable class structure (BEM)
- How smooth scroll elevates perceived UX polish  

**Next Steps**
- Add scroll‑triggered animation using JS observers  
- Introduce dark/light mode theme toggle  
- Explore CSS masking and clip‑path for creative hero designs
